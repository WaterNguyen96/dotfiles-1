#
# A very slightly quicker way to credit an author on commit(s).
#
# $1 - The full name of the author.
# $2 - The email address of the author.
# $3 - The commit(s) to be re-credited
#
# Examples
#   For instance, you accidentally has commited as Foo Bar <foo.bar@example.com> starting at a0z8p3
#   git credit "Zach Holman" zach@example.com a0z8p3^
#

git rebase $3 --exec "git commit --amend --author "$1 <$2>" --no-edit"
